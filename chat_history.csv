dc21328a7e70400ca0ec67033f7c614f,AI," JAX is a machine learning framework for numerical computation with automatic differentiation. It is primarily used for building and training machine learning models, and it is known for its efficiency and ease of use. JAX supports multiple programming languages, including Python and JavaScript, and it can be used for both research and production applications. JAX's automatic differentiation feature allows for efficient computation of gradients, which is essential for training deep neural networks. Additionally, JAX's dynamic computation graph enables efficient parallelization and vectorization, making it a powerful tool for large-scale machine learning projects."
